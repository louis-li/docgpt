Scope This Section applies to all Countries within Zurich P&C authorized to write case underwriting business in Property Damage (PD) and Business Interruption (BI) products. When underwriting a risk, each Underwriter has four primary functions, these are: 1. Risk Selection: This is absolutely the most critical function an Underwriter performs; seniority within Zurich and levels of Authority in specialized industries especially, consider this above other functions. While all are important, this is the foundation. If an Underwriter gets pricing wrong, he or she can cost Zurich tens of thousands of dollars. If he or she gets deductibles and policy wording wrong, they can cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars; if they get risk selection wrong, especially repeatedly, they can cost us millions or tens of millions of dollars. 2. Establishing Appropriate Terms and Conditions for the Risk: Extent of covers provided, Deductibles, Sublimit, and policy language are critical for maintaining consistent and long-term profitability across a book of business. This guideline will go through many of the common / standard rules and wordings required. However, an Underwriter also needs to be aware that many industries have their own unique requirements; and indeed, every account has differing levels of sensitivity to policy wordings. There is no substitute for an Underwriters intimate knowledge of a specific account, the industry perils, and lessons learned. When in doubt, even the most senior Underwriters are encouraged to reach out to Subject Matter Experts (SME) within their own country, or via Zurich\u2019s main strength being our global network. It is an expressed aspirational goal of our team to build a culture of global connectivity, allowing such conversations to be second nature. (Resource vs request of empowerment requirement). 3. Establishing the Appropriate Price for the Risk: While this function is indeed critical, and to be taken seriously, it is too often the sole focus of many within our culture. This guideline and country specific guidelines may provide rules and restrictions; but Underwriters are encouraged to hone their skills primarily on functions 1 and 2 above; when difficult decisions are sometimes needed on this function (lower AP/MP), those discussions and decisions can be much easier when built on a solid foundation of risk quality and terms. 4. Data: Last but not least, data quality. Underwriters and Countries BUs are responsible for data quality and completeness in the underwriting and pricing systems, including but not limited to setting the accounts as bound. Without such data quality and right attention to details, the data has the material risk of representing a picture different from reality and wrongly informing portfolio planning, portfolio management, underwriting strategy and actions in a short and long term and inevitably impacting our performance. Zurich determines gross line setting and net retention calculation on the total exposure of the analysed locations, irrespective of whether covered by one or several policies from a single or several insureds. The exposure calculation includes all covered PD, BI (including Interdependency, CBI and extensions (for example, debris removal, extra expenses, and Claims Preparation fees) covered at the analysed location/site as well as known accumulations across several policies/programs. Please consult the ZUG Glossary for the definition Gross Limits and Gross exposure. For E&P, the line setting includes all covered PD, CoW, LOPI, TPL, and any additional coverage\u2019s, for example, Debris Removal, Sue and Labor etc., covered at the analyzed location/site as well as known accumulations across multiple policies and/or programs. The exposure is defined per location (site/premise) as: \u2022 The Trusted Estimated Maximum Loss (Trusted EML) or, if this is not available. Property ZUG 02.08.2022 1.1. Background 2. Methodology for line setting and net retention calculation Version 2.0 10 INTERNAL USE ONLY"}, {"page_number": 11, "page_content": "\u2022 The Amount Subject or, if this is not available. \u2022 The Total Sum Insured (TSI) of any one site/premises or, if this is not available. \u2022 The TSI or maximum limit of liability (loss limit) of the policy. The exposure definition is used to describe the maximum amount of risk Zurich is willing to accept. The maximum limit of liability (loss limit/policy limit) can also be used for the exposure calculation when it is lower than one of the measurements mentioned under the first three bullet points above. When the site TSI exceeds USD 315 million based on Zurich Net and Treaty, a second qualified Zurich risk engineer has to peer review the on-site assessment for the EML to be used for Line Setting purposes as a Trusted EML Trusted EML cannot be determined before an actual site visit has been carried out by a Zurich risk engineer. EML estimates from sources other than Zurich risk engineers cannot form the basis of a Trusted EML. For High Rise buildings, there is guidance on how to create EMLs and starting point should be an initial assumption of total loss 100% PD, please see full guidance in the Global High Rise Building Property UW How to Document. For all Mid-Market (as per Country financial booking definition), Downstream Energy risks, as well as most Heavy Chemical Risks (please refer to the Hazard Grade list on Globuz 2.0), the exposure is the policy/contract maximum limit of indemnity (loss limit). In case a policy does not have a maximum limit of indemnity (loss limit), the TSI of the key location is the exposure. For the TSI calculation, the Underwriter includes all additional covers and extensions within the policy. Special consideration needs to be considered for any Interdependencies if Business Interruption / Extra Expense is provided, as well as Contingent Time Element covers when calculating the maximum TSI. In case AS or TSI is used for line-setting, the policy language is reviewed to ascertain the maximum limit of liability under the policy or program (in case multiple policies are issued). In a limit-based policy, the maximum limit should be set in relation to the actual TSI of the largest location and may include an additional buffer of 10-30 % to cater for extensions (incl. interdependency). In a sum insured based policy, either a maximum policy limit should be set following the same principles (if permissible) or first loss extensions limits are fully added to determine the TSI. It is critical that such extension limits are provided in a reasonable relation to the sums insured (e.g. 10-15 % max). Any Leeway or Margin clause should be limited (e.g. 10 % of the sums insured). In International Programs local policies (non-Prime) are usually sum insured based and policy limits are not possible in all countries. Please check also in MIA in Territory. If replacement cost is provided, an Average Clause (US: Coinsurance clause) should be added, to ensure a correct declaration of value. For any guidance on replacement cost, appraisal and declaration of values, please consult the Global Historic and Unique Buildings Property UW How to Document Also, we want to avoid by any means losses that exceed the TSI due to poor language (example of unacceptable language is \u201cdeclared values are only informative in nature\u201d). \u2022 Requests for empowerment above country are not required when line setting is based on TEML and the TEML is lower than USD 750 Mio.

The Zurich Risk Engineering Technical Standard for EML specifies that: EML \u201cEstimated Maximum Loss\u201d is the largest monetary loss (property damage plus business interruption) of values at risk that may be expected to result from a peril in a single insured event, with controls impaired and delayed manual intervention.

Global UW Property Limits and Mandatory restrictions in Appendix 1 outline the maximum allowed limit and restriction by empowerment level, applicable to direct as well as facultative assumed business. - The Global Property Underwriting message to the market needs to be globally consistent and predictable within each market that we operate, with the empowerment to make decisions close to the customer. This document outlines the strategy to deploy line setting capacity based on a combination of Account and Location-Based deployment. We expect disciplined risk taking to be based on a culture of risk awareness. This will allow us to achieve our visions of customer focus, maximizing capacity on Excellent and Good accounts, and delivery of our financial goals and objectives. \u2022 Risk Information: Our intent is to write what we know and know what we write. We cannot execute on this without good information. While assumptions are allowed if supported by a logical rationale, we write risk only on an informed basis. Furthermore, while Underwriters earn the ability to use more and more judgement as their level of authority increases, this is not a license to write risks blindly. Heavy responsibility comes along with empowerment. \u2022 Capacity: Zurich is a Gross Lines Underwriting company and we will focus on both Net and Treaty capacity. Reinsurance is not to be used as a tool to write accounts which we should be avoiding, as our Underwriting judgment about the risk quality drives the capacity deployed. We are keen to take risk but we try to avoid or at least limit deploying capacity on any poor risks. In addition to this, our relationship with our reinsurance partners is strategic and has to be preserved for the long term. \u2022 Line Size: Our goal is to maximize line size on desirable business (irrespective of UW Authority level), within the appetite. Thus, even Level 1 Underwriters should be proactively seeking appropriate levels of empowerment to maximize Zurich\u2019s footprint on the best accounts. This helps ensure that we gain critical mass on the best accounts, and also supports a lower expense ratio. (The same effort is needed to underwrite a 10% line as there is to underwrite a 30% lead line). \u2022 Tools: This document provides examples of the types of scenarios when Location Based facultative tools can be employed. Underwriters can use these tools even when not mandated. \u2022 Consistent and predictable marketing message of the Global Property Underwriting risk appetite aligned to capacity setting. \u2022 Opportunity to grow both our top line production and improved our P&L by reducing our net exposure to poor locations, and consistently maximizing capacity deployed. \u2022 Reduction of volatility in the net retention and leading to improved profitability. \u2022 Reduction of operational risk by streamlining access to reinsurance, coupled with improved price.

At the same time, every Underwriter is fully aware of the basic principle that it would be extremely dangerous to be overweight on any individual account with respect to line size. By consistently adhering to limits indicated in Appendix 1, we will reduce volatility and help to ensure profitability of the Property / Energy & Technical risk segment. - Account Line setting for Property / Energy & Technical Risks is governed by maximum amounts set against both percentage and monetary value, whichever the lesser. This is based on Hazard Grade and Overall Account Risk Quality Rating. See Appendix 2 for details on Account based capacity deployment matrix. Our Risk Appetite is defined by the use of Fire Hazard Grades and Overall Account Risk Quality Rating. 1. Hazard Grades \u2013 Account Level: Hazard Grade refers to FLEXA hazard. Capacity is determined on an account basis, based on the most hazardous activity. The Hazard Grade for a specific occupancy applies to the entire account unless the high hazard activity is incidental i.e. less than 20% of the overall policy Total Insured Value. If an asset is ceded via external Facultative cession, it is still accounted for within the Hazard Grade calculation for capacity deployment purposes. If we write a lower Hazard Grade account with incidental values in a higher Hazard Grade, Underwriters might consider accessing the Auto-fac Facility for the higher incidental Hazard Grade exposure. 2. Overall Account Risk Quality Rating (OARQR): The OARQR is calculated as a weighted average of all the assessed location Risk Grading Scores (FLEXA and Business Interruption), including the ones below USD 2.5m TIV if risk grading score is present. For further detail, please refer to Appendix 4 \u2013 OARQR All assessment types indicated in Appendix 3 can be used to determine OARQR. Where the engagement of Risk Engineering is required according to Appendix 3, only Risk Grading assessments produced by Zurich Risk Engineering (ZRE) staff, Underwriters trained by ZRE or vendors managed by ZRE can be directly used in the underwriting process. Other third party reports or forms of risk information require validation by ZRE. An account defined as Commercial Property based on the Account Level rule above can have locations with exposures closer to Energy or Technical Risk than Commercial Property. For every such location, incidental Energy or Technical Risk, exposure is defined as: 1. PD Energy or Technical Risk value being less than 10% of the Total Sum Insured at a single location AND 2. PD Energy or Technical Risk coverage including MB coverage (PD Energy or PD Technical Risk comprehensive of MB part + MB-BI) is less than USD 25 million (for Power Gen, Mining and Technical Risk) and USD 10 million for Downstream, Midstream, Heavy Chem on a 100% basis per location, irrespective of the Zurich line OR MB coverage is on a stand-alone basis, this exception only applies where the MB coverage (Material Damages for MB part only + MB-BI) is less than USD 10 million on a 100% basis per location, irrespective of the Zurich line AND 3.

For more indication on deductibles, please consult the Global Energy and Technical Risks Segment UW How to Document The maximum net and treaty Property capacity (\u201cGross Net\u201d) for Zurich globally is USD 400 million before any facultative reinsurance, including Auto-fac. ZNA has access to separate quota share and even larger excess auto-fac facilities, which can also expand their net and treaty amount. While this represents our maximum net and treaty capacity, it does not mean that we seek to deploy this on every account. The normal maximum limits Zurich is willing to deploy are detailed in the tables as per Appendix 2. Note that all percentages and monetary amounts are expressed in terms of Zurich Gross Net (also known as \u201cNet & Treaty\u201d) capacity. Please see Location Based Capacity Deployment section 4.3 for guidance on risk tolerance and appetite within net retention. It is important to identify OARQR prior to any Location Based protection. In other words, locations rated as \u201cPoor\u201d are included in the Overall Account Risk Quality Rating calculation, even if we purchase auto-fac protection for these locations. A minimum density ratio of risk assessment information is required (except for Upstream), in order to develop an Overall Account Risk Quality Rating. A further requirement is the need to assess at least the top three locations where an account has 10 or more locations. This will help ensure that the Overall Account Risk Quality Ratings is truly reflective of the entire account, and not just of the top location.

In cases of accounts with participation on excess layer, the exposure values to be taken into consideration to calculate the required minimum density ratios are limited to the total insured values (from ground up including interdependency values) of all locations exposed within the excess layer.

Appendix 3 indicates Location assessment requirements by peril to fulfill the minimum density requirements and Minimum Information Requirements, representing the expected normal minimum acceptable information sought by Zurich prior to writing a Property risk. Please note that the frequency of assessment applies to FLEXA assessment only. \u2022 An UW is expected to determine the type of assessment required for every location based on four tables (FLEXA and other perils, BI, FLOOD, EQ, WS). \u2022 The UW is to work with the Account Engineer or Risk Engineer responsible for the account to refine the type of assessment, based on data quality improvement (geocode, use of local hazard maps, etc.) as well as available information, e.g. RE assessment reports for locations already serviced by RE. \u2022 An UW can deviate from type of assessment required settling for lower assessment level, however the location will not count towards density (please note density rules currently apply only for FLEXA). \u2022 The above are minimum requirements for assessment assignments. It is recommended to complete the assignments of assessments together with the account engineer or similar in order to ascertain all hazards are covered as well as all special additional insurance coverages are discussed and taken in consideration. \u2022 Based on the type of assessment required by peril, the UW and RE agree on a RE service plan. \u2022 The service plan should also include the assessment type for natural hazards. A multi-peril assessment with various levels of assessment may be required at a single location. The UW and RE are to prioritize the perils to be assessed and the associated timeline. \u2022 The UW and the RE Account Engineer decide together on the appropriate BI service levels for the locations based on BI hazard grades and BI sums exposed per locations. The higher the BI Hazard Grade and the BI sum exposed the higher and comprehensive the BI service level (see BI segmentation matrix: BI service level 0, no RE BI service to BI service level 3: most comprehensive BI service level including interdependency analysis). For BI service level 2 and 3 especially in case required information on BI risk (including interdependencies) is not available or BI risk (including interdependencies) is rated fair or poor, capacity on BI is to be deployed conservatively.

However, whenever possible, the \"Hail and Windstorm (other than Named Storm)\" endorsement (available for all states except California, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, New York, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico) shall be used to sublimit exposures in exposed Tornado areas. Alternatively, location limits can be offered to sublimit Tornado. \u2022 For Non-ZNA Produced business, the Business unit shall always sublimit Tornado (i.e. Windstorm, other than Named Storm) under the local US policies in line with the limit for Windstorm under the Master Policy.

Flood definitions like \u2018within the 100-year zone\u2019 are not practicable in countries where there is no recognized zoning system and are likely to create uncertainty and discussions after a claim. Even in countries where flood zones are defined, it is best practice to explicitly identify individual locations that are known to be exposed to avoid any ambiguity after a loss regarding coverage. Due to recent losses and the difference between US FEMA Flood Map and CRI scoring, underwriters are required to check and use the most conservative of both.

Underwriters need to be aware of the impact weather phenomenon other than Named Windstorm and Flood, such as strong Convective storms, can have on the risks insured. Risks are to be assessed for structural integrity, damageability, quality, and potential loss. The Underwriter has to be aware of critical known areas where the occurrences of such weather-related events have higher probability either due to historical incidents or based on local standards, guidelines, hazard maps, etc. Risk Engineering can provide support in this assessment. In most countries tornado is part of windstorm and can be limited. However, in the US and Canada and countries where wind is named (hurricane, typhoon) there can be an issue with tornado not being sublimited. Where legally possible from a regulatory point of view (limiting endorsement accepted by regulator) we should sublimit the tornado exposure either as part of the windstorm limit or a separate limit. Other solutions to limit the tornado exposure are the application of location limits or policy limits. Tornado is the governing peril to which we set TEMLs when the risk is situated in Zurich US Tornado Zones 4- 6, or CRI scores 7-10, or, when using local resources, hazard levels \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cVery High\u201d, as defined in the pertinent risk engineering standard.

CBI Our Risk Appetite for CBI is directly linked into risk (individual and accumulative), the certainty of the underwriting considerations and the expected behaviour of our customers and their supply chain partners. The following elements drive our appetite: \u2022 The level of understanding of the risk (hazard, exposure, controls) at the supplier or customer and the impact an event can have on our insured; \u2022 The significance of risk of accumulation potential within one insurance program (one supplier impacting multiple locations of our insured) as well across insurance programs (one supplier impacting multiple of our insureds) and our current level of accumulation and available capacity; \u2022 The risk management behavior at the supplier or customer locations and our insured\u2019s influence here-on; \u2022 The supply chain management level, -integration and the resilience in the business model at our insured and our influence here-on; \u2022 The type of industry and the level of specialization and dependency on the supplier/customer (single source/single location), see critical industries.

It is imperative that the mill have fully adequate and redundant independent feeds for electricity and fuel. In the absence of either, coverage for SI should NOT be provided. The reason is the potential for the molten material solidifying within the containers and causing damage to them. This is further compounded by the time required to remove the solidified material from these containers. Service Interruption Even with both fuel and electricity duplicated, there should be an absolute minimum of a 24 hour waiting period, except in countries or regions where return of power could be delayed due to natural peril or reliability of power supply, where it should be no less than 72 hours. Refractory Exclusion Refractory is used to line the vessels holding molten materials. This refractory has a limited useful life and is constantly wearing out from the first moment of use. As such, the preferred methodology is to simply exclude all refractory from coverage. However, if this is totally unacceptable to the Insured and if appropriate values have been provided, we can provide coverage on an ACV basis based on the useful life of the refractory. Radioactive Contamination Coverage / Exclusion Many mills today are heavily involved in recycling metals. The source of these metals is not always clear and can represent a severe radioactive contamination exposure. Mills t have (and use) radiation detectors on ALL incoming loads of scrap as well as a final check before the material is added to the mix. Without this, we will NOT provide ANY coverage for this peril. If they have these elements in place, then we can provide some \u201climited\u201d amounts of coverage.

Conditions applying to Oil Sands Technologies Oil Sands projects present complex operational issues and numerous exposures that require a complete risk evaluation of all aspects of risk. The combination of the upstream production of the crude oil supply (typically utilising surface mining techniques, or SAGD \u2013 Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage) with the refining/processing of bitumen challenges the standard understanding of a refining risk. Underwriters have to be experienced in all aspects of Oil Sand Facilities in order to evaluate such risks. Lengthy experience in refining industries is not sufficient for someone to underwrite Oil Sands projects, and Underwriters are required to seek out someone with adequate experience to assist (or refer to the Global Head of Energy). For SAGD technologies, Upstream Underwriters and Risk Engineers are engaged; Mining Underwriters and Risk Engineers should be engaged for the surface or strip mining methods of Oil Sands recovery. il Sands projects are most popularly found in Canada, with other large reserves known to exist in Venezuela, as well as Russia and Kazakhstan. Particular attention should be paid to cold temperature environments, particularly in Canada and Russia, when evaluating our appetite for risk when BI and/or EE is covered.

Saudi Armco, as but one example, is a major / single source gas supplier to many \u201cdownstream\u201d chemical and petrochemical companies. Even if we do not insure SA, or they do not buy BI coverage, it is critical that we are aware of all of the exposures Zurich writes where the loss of a single gas plant could affect more than one of our insureds from a CBI/supplier viewpoint. While Zurich does not currently have sophisticated / automated systems to manage these accumulations, we will be initiating work shortly with our team of global Subject Matter Experts in this space to find the most efficient and effective short term solutions. In the meantime, it is critical that ANY time an Underwriter is insuring assets outside of their home country in any of these industries, detailed dialogue take place with senior Downstream / Heavy Chemical underwriters in our other Centres of Excellence.

Any exceptional empowerment remains subject to the approval processes in the RC. Note that customization does NOT refer to tailoring of the local policy by adapting limits and deductibles to the local risk profile with the use of the standard templates/schedules available in the RC. This is, as a matter of fact, a mandatory requirement for local policies and in the responsibility of the PC underwriter who has to provide PC UWS with respective instructions. For a small selection of large strategic Global Relationship customers there may be the need to export a manuscript wording to the RC (may not be permissible or feasible in all countries, please see MIAinT for information on local capabilities) as mentioned under 7.1.2. The use of any wording that is not Zurich Prime or Local Standard Wording, e.g. full manuscript/exported wordings or broker wordings (unless it is a standard broker form agreed locally by the RC) requires empowerment by the Global Property Underwriting or empowered SME. Any exceptional empowerment remains subject to the approval processes in the RC.

For more information see Risk Engineering's Property Loss Estimates Guidelines. Trusted EML's are those EML's developed by a qualified Zurich risk engineer as part of an onsite assessment. The exposure calculation for underwriting authority, for net retentions and for line setting is based on the total exposure of the analyzed location, independently if covered by one or several policies from a single or several insureds. The exposure calculation must include all covered PD, including BI and extensions, for example, debris removal, CBI, extra expenses, covered at the analyzed location as well as known accumulations across several policies/programs. The methodology is described in section 2.1.1 Line Setting is defined as the maximum net and treaty exposure amounts (gross exposure less un- aggregated captive retention and facultative reinsurance plus known accumulations) at the location under consideration.

This type of flood occurs when the capacity of watercourse is exceeded or the watercourse is blocked, and excess water flood the adjacent areas (the floodplain). In relatively flat areas, floodwaters may rise slow and the shallow, slow-moving floodwater may cover the land for days or even weeks. In hilly mountainous areas, floodwaters may rise quickly after a heavy rain and are called flash floods, in this case. The watercourse may contain water only parts of the year (seasonal watercourses). Riverine Flood (Fluvial flood) Flood Surface water runoff (Pluvial or precipitation flood) This type of flood occurs when the amount of rainfall exceeds the infiltration capacity of the ground or when entering a drainage system, such as an urban water drainage system, exceeds its discharge capacity. Sometime drainage system discharge is blocked due to a high water level in the receiving watercourse or obstructing debris. The excess water flows overland, ponding in natural hollows and low-lying areas or behind obstructions.

Parametric Insurance Products or Coverage are considered New Product, Coverage or Service to Zurich as not currently sold elsewhere by Zurich. Non Standard Endorsement Non-Standard endorsements are generally available modifications to Standard and Non-Standard policy wordings. Non-Standard endorsements do not include Manuscript endorsements, standard endorsements or endorsements required to modify a policy form to meet county/state-specific requirements. Non-Standard policy wordings Nuclear Pools For the purpose of the section \u2018Nuclear Pools\u2019 are considered to be any scheme, reinsurance facility or any other participation which has been created by the local insurance market and/or governments to provide coverage for Nuclear Power Generation risks, even though if technically they might not be considered to be a \u2018Pool\u2019.

OARQR Overall Account Risk Quality Rating Operational Key Controls (OKC) is the system used by P&C Underwriting to document risks and controls and record the OKC sign off process. RACE is owned by GRM Needs amendment. The Operational Key Controls (OKC) framework is based on the key underwriting risks that are common across P&C Underwriting and the controls that have been identified to mitigate them. Group Underwriting Excellence and Group Risk Management (GRM) work together to develop and monitor implementation of OKC. RACE Operational Plan The Operational Plan is the roadmap which defines the business actions that must be taken and prioritized activities necessary to achieve the plan. Offshore Offshore risks are all risks that are located in the open sea and are not firmly connected to land or coast. Risks that are firmly connected to land or coast and extend into the open sea, such as, but not limited to, terminals, lighthouses, windfarms, piers, jetties and the Channel Tunnel (or property in it) are classed as onshore risks. Water intakes and outfalls that go from land into the sea for 5km or less are classed as onshore. Pipelines (other than water intakes and outfalls) that stretch into the sea are considered offshore beyond the first land valve, the first pump station on land, pier or jetty, or the first distribution station or flange on land, pier or jetty. Parafiscal taxes Parafiscal taxes include taxes such as fire brigade tax, contribution to social funds etc. In general, reinsurance transactions are not liable to premium/parafiscal taxes, but there are exceptions. It is required that for each transaction the correct amount of premium/parafiscal tax is paid. This needs improvement.

Portfolio Profitability Reviews (PPRs) are a structured series of analyses and meetings, with the purpose of framing and shaping strategic portfolio management and underwriting objectives. Meetings are held before the start of the annual planning round and the results of the GPR are used to inform the Annual Plan. Probable Maximum Loss (PML) PML \u201cProbable Maximum Loss\u201d is the largest monetary loss (property damage plus business interruption) of values at risk that may be expected to result from a peril in a single insured event, with available controls as assessed including timely manual intervention. Property & Business Interruption It includes: \u2022 All segments (except Personal Lines). \u2022 Energy business (the Processing and Refining of Oil, Gas, Chemical and Petrochemicals; Mining; Power Generation; Exploration and Production of Oil and Gas) \u2022 Machinery Breakdown (MB)/Builder\u2019s Risk and Marine covers when included as an integral part of a PD and BI Insurance policy. \u2022 All associated extensions, indirect costs and expenses (e.g. debris removal, contingent business interruption (CBI) etc.). \u2022 Supply Chain Insurance and other specifically developed Property products. Note a specific authority grant is required to offer this product. Public Utilities (also known as \u201cBI service interruption\u201d) Reasonable foreseeability REDS Request for Empowerment The request for empowerment always includes the recommendation and rationale. It does not preclude the responsibility of the underwriter requesting empowerment for the transaction: the underwriter making the request is making a recommendation to proceed and has accountability for the transaction. The receiving underwriter may give the empowerment (say yes) with or without recommendations, but this does not \"transfer\" accountability for the transaction from the underwriter recommending it. Coverage refers to business interruption caused by a failure in the supply of electricity, fuel, gas, refrigerant, steam, water, or communication supply services caused by an insured material damage loss at third party premises (not necessarily publicly owned but used by the public). Please note that the focus of this manual is the BI aspect resulting from an insured peril, not the material damage itself. Underwriters should be aware that in some countries coverage is extended to \u2018all-risks\u2019 which may not necessarily be caused by an insured material damage Zurich uses the common sense method to determine clash, \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d, a concept requiring underwriters\u2019 judgment. Such judgment must couple the underwriter\u2019s experience in the particular line of business with an appreciation of the potential impact on and by other lines of business. Underwriters determine reasonable foreseeability by using account clearance systems to identify those risks with multiple Zurich participants. REDS is a global data store having a standardized one Zurich view of our risk exposure across regions, countries and lines of business. The process of delegating underwriting authority requires a comprehensive request for empowerment process to deal with those cases that exceed the authority granted to individuals. If an account falls outside the Country\u2019s authority, empowerment must be requested to the next appropriate level. Reverse Takeover / Reverse Merger Locomotives, railway cars (for passenger and/or cargo), tram/light rail cars, subway cars, self- driven/automated mass transportation systems and in general any rolling material operated on rail tracks or dedicated infrastructures/tracks (e.g. cable or magnetic propelled vehicles) other than the ones operated/sheltered on insured own premises (e.g. trains when within stations or depots - not in movement) Also known as a \u201cReverse IPO\u201d, a process whereby a private company purchases a publicly traded company (usually a shell company with only an organizational structure and little/no activity) with the purpose of avoiding the regulatory and financial requirements associated with an IPO.

Spot Check The spot check review is an inspection or investigation that is carried out at random, or in some instances a targeted review of selected number of underwriting topics. The Spot Check is a key component of the Underwriting Quality Landscape which is generally characterized by a higher level of independence; however, this approach can be conducted locally. It is designed as a quick, simple and adaptable way of assuring the quality of the Underwriting process. It may generate further actions for underwriting improvement. Stacking is the accumulation of net retentions and/or treaty capacities within the same LOB on the same risk. Stacking can also occur within a captive program when accepting facultative reinsurance or a retrocession. Stacking Underwriters must determine potential stacking of net retentions by using existing accumulation management systems, Risk Exposure Data Store (REDS) where available, and/or account clearance systems or tools. In the absence of such systems or tools, underwriters must use good sense to contact colleagues within their Country, in a different segment within their country and elsewhere in the Group, with a particular focus on the country of domicile of the insured. Standard endorsements Standard endorsements are generally available modifications to standard policy wordings that form part of a \u201cZurich Product\u201d and have been reviewed by Zurich Legal and Claims. Standard endorsements do not include Manuscript endorsements or endorsements required to modify a policy form to meet country/state-specific requirements.

System Failure An outage or failure of a computer network, whether due to either hardware or software, that causes the network to freeze, reboot, malfunction or otherwise fail to perform its intended function. Systemic Risk Systemic Risk is the accumulation of losses triggered by a single event or cause, affecting an industry segment or multiple industries rather than an isolated single risk. The accumulation of losses from Systemic Risk can take place across many policyholders and policy years. These accumulations can relate to multiple industries, systems, processes, products or substances, tangible or intangible. They can emerge years after the original exposure was underwritten, and may involve mass tort claims.

Location Assessment \u2013 General A Full Risk Engineering Assessment can be carried out in the form of a Desktop Assessment (without a physical visit to the location) or an of On-Site Assessment. \"Adequate Information\" as defined in the Glossary of this guideline is required to carry out a Desktop Assessment. Such \"Adequate Information\" is typically obtained from a non-Zurich risk engineer (broker or other third party) that has collected the relevant information and evidence while being physically at the location. The Zurich risk engineer that carries out a Desktop Assessment utilizes public sources of information or contacts the customer as directly to complement necessary. When a Full Risk Engineering Assessment is required and obtaining \"Adequate Information\" is not feasible without a physical visit to the location, an On-Site Assessment by a Zurich risk engineer would be needed. An Exposure Review is carried out with less than \"Adequate Information\", mainly utilizing first-hand information directly from the customer's location staff, the broker or other third parties and public sources of information.

Geocode/Address verification There is no density or re-assessment frequency requirement for natural hazard assessments. However it is essential that addresses and/or geocodes provided by the customer / broker of any locations with Zurich Gross-Net values over USD 200 Mio are verified to ensure the adequate level of assessment is determined. The verified geocodes will be input for risk modelling tools and pricing. Such verification is visually done by the underwriter using public maps, e.g. Google Map or Bing Map (refer to table of Minimum Information \u2013 Risk Assessment Requirements for geocodes verification requirement). Please note that incorrect information of geocodes can also be due to incorrect address provided by customer / broker.
