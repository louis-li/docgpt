Hail events in the United States have increased in frequency and severity; as a result, a clear statement of the hail underwriting approach is needed to effectively manage exposure to loss. The goal is to limit exposure to loss in the high and moderate risk states\u2019 counties through exposure awareness, risk selection, policy terms and deductible requirements. The appetite is for geographically well diversified accounts. With that in mind accounts only located in Zurich Zones 4, 5 and 6 are not in appetite, but that does not mean they cannot be considered for coverage. However, it does mean they need a higher level of due diligence and prudent terms. It should be a red flag to underwriters when the account consists of what we term \u201closs driven occupancies\u201d as shown below. Like the statement above, these risks need higher level of due diligence, applying good risk selection (or sometimes declination) and most prudent terms and conditions. Occupancies Comments Hospitals Significant sq ft, multi roof levels, mixed roof types, mix of roof/bldg. ages, HVACs Education Difficulty executing expedient repairs if public entity. Nursing Homes Typically, one story with a large footprint. Real Estate (Including Malls present a significant exposure due to sizeable footprint, skylights, atriums, signage and diminishing funds for infrastructure. Warehouses) Hotels/Hospitality Significant exposure due to skylights, atriums, extensive HVACs, signage, awnings, sun shades. Retail Significant exposure due to skylights, atriums, HVACs, signage and diminishing funds for infrastructure. Back to Top 2 Strategic Directive This directive applies only when real property coverage applies. Typically, no specific action is needed to address the peril of hail when exposure is exclusively to business personal property and time element coverages. The Underwriter may work independently without collaboration with a Hail SME if they apply the deductibles as outlined in the Hail Business Strategic Directive. The Underwriter may deviate and work independently for any account in a state identified below as High or Moderate hazard where: \u2022 the hail exposed TIV is less than $25M, and \u2022 the building TIV is less than $10M INTERNAL USE ONLY Copyright \u00a92021 Zurich.

This is a per occurrence deductible and applies to each building separately. - \u4e00 A per occurrence deductible can be used in lieu of premises deductibles, however it is expected that the occurrence deductible would be at least equivalent to the sum total of the per premise deductibles for all buildings logically included in the occurrence. \u2022 Practically speaking, an occurrence will most likely be limited within one county, and possibly even within just one city.
